Due to my graduation project and class projects, I don't have time for this project right now.

***
In this project, an agent is trained on-line, using keypresses as the labels for movement and 2 frames as the input in game Minecraft.
Model predicts if the player is moving forward or backward, based on the current frame and the previous frame.
